## Kit or DIY

### Kits
#### Pros
* Easiest way to get started
* Great if you don’t have a 3D printer
* Less chance you’ll break something
* Probably more competitive to start
#### Cons
* More expensive - Maybe
* Less Choice

### DIY
#### Pros
* Full control
* Builds the skills you’ll need later
* Can be cheaper - Maybe
* We think it’s more fun

#### Cons
* Steeper learning curve
* Can feel like too many choices
* Need more tools (Check for Maker Spaces and Library!)

## Design
* TinkerCAD
* Fusion 360
* Onshape
* So Many More
####  Let's design a robot

##  Slicing and Printing
* PLA+/PETG vs ABS/ASA/TPU/Nylon
* Make your shells thick!
* You don’t need 100% infill!
