# Combat Robotics in Three Hours

#### Welcome to Combat Robotics in Three Hours (CRi3H).  Our mission is to spread the fun of combat robotics, with a focus on affordable, approachable ways to get started.

## Origins

CRi3H is inspired by the 'Robot in 3 Days (Ri3D)' challenge, which is done every year as part of the kickoff week for the [First Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) season.  Using that as a model, we set out to design, manufacture, wire, and assemble a small combat robot within 3 Hours.  We then immediately take the robots to compete, so there's no cheating!

We have lots of content planned!  But while we get our ducks in a row on that, here's a peek as to what's to come...

## CRi3H Debut

At [DragonCon](https://www.dragoncon.org/) 2022, we hosted 3 sessions as part of the Robotics and Maker track as our inaugural session.  We succeeded in building 2 antweight robots on-site and competing in [Robot Battles](http://www.robotbattles.com/), which is hosted at the convention every year.
